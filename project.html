    <h2>Deep Learning for Computer Vision, Speech, and Language</h2>
   
   <p> We will have a poster presentation on Dec 11, 7pm-10pm. This is to show case every team's project to the class, 
   and the most popular project will be awarded to an Idol Award. See <a href="http://llcao.net/cu-deeplearning17/project.html">examples of project in the previous year</a>.   
   </p>
   
   <p>
   Every team is required to submit a report:
   <ul>
       <li> 4 pages double column (in <a href="https://2018.ieeeicassp.org/papers/PaperKit.html">ICASSP</a> format)
       or 8 pages single column (in <a href="https://nips.cc/Conferences/2018/PaperInformation/StyleFiles">NIPS</a> format).
       <li> Reports will be reviewed as the same standard as top conferences (e.g., CVPR/ICCV/ECCV for vision, 
       ICASSP/Interspeech for speech, ACL/NAACL/EMNLP for vision). We hope students can learn from the papers 
       that they presented in the class </a>.
       <li> If teachers agree that a report has the quality or potential of a top conference publication, 
       all members of the team will receive a A+ as their final grade. 
   </ul>
   </p>
   
   <p>
   More detailed arrangement will come soon.
