    <h4> Poster representation </h4>
   <p> We will have a poster presentation on Dec 11, 7pm-10pm. This is to show case every team's project to the class, 
   and the most popular project will be awarded to an Idol Award. See <a href="http://llcao.net/cu-deeplearning17/project.html">examples of project in the previous year</a>.   
   </p>
    
    <p>
        The poster session will be at <b>750 CEPSR</b>. Note it is no longer the classroom at Mudd Mudding!
   </p>
   
   
    <h4> Project report </h4>

   After the poster presentation, every team is required to submit a report:
   <ul>
       <li> - 4 pages double column (in <a href="https://2018.ieeeicassp.org/papers/PaperKit.html">ICASSP</a> format)
       or 8 pages single column (in <a href="https://nips.cc/Conferences/2018/PaperInformation/StyleFiles">NIPS</a> format).
       <li> - Reports will be reviewed in the same standard as top conferences (e.g., CVPR/ICCV/ECCV for vision, 
       ICASSP/Interspeech for speech, ACL/NAACL/EMNLP for NLP, NIPS/ICML/ICLR for learning). Our best hope is that good student 
           reports are like the papers selected for student presentations. </a>.
       <li> - If teachers agree that a report has the quality or potential of a top conference publication, 
       all members of the team will receive a A+ as their final grade. 
       <li> - The deadline for the course report is Dec 19, 00:00am.     
   </ul>

   
   <b> Frequent questions </b> (keep updating) <br>
    
   <p> Must we put a conference level poster? Coz it may be expensive. <br>
       A: You can print a number of slides on A4 paper, and stick them to the board. Poster format is not required. 
       Our experience is a video demo or even an interactive demo helps more than posters.
    </p>
    
    <p> Percentage grade division between poster presentation and project report? <br>
        A: There is no strict percentage. We give grades based on the quality of the project work, for which both 
        poster presentation and project report help us understand your project work better. <br>
        In  our previous courses,  the popular posters are always among the best research work. We believe it is 
        because the peer presenters are also good audience. It is also the case in top conferences. 
    </p>    
    
    <p> Project code submission required? need to be open sourced? <br>
        A: Code submission is encouraged but not required. You can choose to be open sourced or not. 
    </p>    

    <p> What if my report is longer than the page limits? <br>
        A: Long reports will not be published.
